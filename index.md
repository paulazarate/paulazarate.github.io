I am a computer science major at California State University, Fullerton and plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 7, part 1
This was one of my favorite labs because we got to use multiple if statements. I really liked having to figure out what the logic behind the if statements were going to be. This lab really helped me practice putting logic into my code.

Lab 8, part 2
I really enjoyed this lab because we got to practice using for loops. It was closely related to our notes in class which helped me with the lab. I really like the logic we had to use this lab to make sure our end result displayed the pattern of -,*, and /. I liked how we had to make a loop inside of a loop.

Lab 6, part 2
I liked this lab because I got to learn about the game blackjack and how to implement it into our code. I most enjoyed the functions file because we got to assign all the cards depending if they were number, face, or ace cards. This lab helped me practice my coding and problem solving skills.
